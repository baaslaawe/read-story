<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Jumping
In</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 I learned to swim
in the pond near my apartment when I was little. There was no dock.
There was no diving board. One time I dove off a rock headfirst and
landed on my belly. It really hurt, so I decided I was done with
diving. I never did learn how to dive headfirst.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Then, last summer,
a new pool opened in our town. It had high diving boards and low
ones, too. I took one look and decided that I was never going
headfirst off those boards!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 It was really hot
in July. My baby cousin Jasper was visiting. I begged Margaret, our
sitter, to take us to the pool. She finally agreed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 We plunked our
stuff on the cement near the diving board. Margaret said I could swim
while she watched Jasper.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 After a while, I
climbed up the ladder out of the pool. Jasper was banging on a beach
ball with a plastic shovel. Margaret was putting on sunblock and
talking on her phone.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 I was hungry. I
dried off with a towel and rummaged through the beach bag for
something to eat.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 I never even heard
a splash, but when I looked up, Jasper’s beach ball was in the
water right in front of the high diving board. His shovel was on the
cement. I jumped up and saw Jasper’s striped sun hat bobbing in the
water. I figured Margaret would come rescue Jasper, but she was
talking to some boys sitting nearby. I knew there was no time to
lose.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 I raced to the
edge of the pool and dove in headfirst. I aimed for an empty spot
between a bunch of kids swimming near where I could see Jasper’s
hat.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 It was a clean
dive. I opened my eyes and saw Jasper kicking in the water, even
before I came up for air. I grabbed my little cousin and shot up to
the surface.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 Jasper coughed. A
little water dribbled out of his mouth. He laughed and pointed to the
water. “Again! Do it again!” he begged.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 I was not going
to let Jasper go back in the water. But now I knew I could dive when
I had to, and maybe someday I would try it again.
