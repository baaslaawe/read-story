<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Battle for the Mercedes Treasure</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 In October 1804,
Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes was sailing with three other vessels
through the waters west of Portugal. In its hold were 900,000 silver
and gold coins brought from Peru, a Spanish colony at the time. After
seven months at sea, the ships had almost reached their
destination—Cádiz, Spain—when they were attacked by British
warships. The other three Spanish ships were captured, but the
Mercedes exploded. More than 200 crew members were killed, and the
valuable cargo sank to the ocean floor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Skip ahead about
200 years to May 2007. The American company Odyssey Marine
Exploration announced that it had salvaged a fabulous treasure from a
shipwreck off the coast of Portugal. The company code-named the ship
the Black Swan. It kept the wreck’s location and other details a
careful secret.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Shortly afterward,
Spain declared that the ship was the Mercedes. Spain stressed that
the Mercedes had belonged to the Spanish government. This was a very
important point. Laws of the sea prohibit treasure-hunting on navy or
other state-owned vessels. If the Black Swan was really the Mercedes,
the treasure would belong to Spain. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Spain was serious.
It filed a claim in U.S. courts and, in October 2007, held Odyssey’s
ship captain overnight for questioning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 The case was very
complicated, but Odyssey argued that it had found the ship and that
it had been abandoned. There was no proof that the ship was the
Mercedes. Even if that could be proved, claimed Odyssey, the Mercedes
was on a commercial voyage, not a government one. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Complicating
things even more, Peru made its own claim. The Spanish conquerors had
minted the coins from minerals stolen from the native people, it
said. Therefore, Peru should get at least part of the treasure. (The
court did not agree with Peru’s arguments.) 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 One other group
was watching closely: marine archaeologists. They wanted to
discourage treasure-hunting because it harms underwater historic
sites and destroys important information such sites can provide.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 In the end, Spain
won the case. Some thought the decision unfair. After all, Odyssey
had spent huge amounts of money and effort to find and recover the
treasure. But Spain said that was Odyssey’s own fault. It should
not have disturbed the wreck in the first place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 In February 2012,
the treasure crossed the Atlantic once more, this time on airplanes.
Though Spain needs money, the coins—valued at more than $500
million—won’t be sold to collectors. Instead, for the first time
in its long history, the Mercedes treasure will be out in the open,
exhibited in museums for everyone to see.</p>
