<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Spider
and the Sun</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Long
ago, before there was day and night, the animals had no fire and
there was no light. There was so little food that their stomachs
shriveled up like raisins. Finally, they decided that someone must
find Sun, which only shone on the other side of the mountain.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Skunk
volunteered to go first. He found Sun and took a tiny, glowing piece
of him in his paw. However, on the way back home, the piece of Sun
slipped out of his paw, slid down his back, and disappeared. Skunk
returned home with a white streak down his back.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Eagle
went next. She flew up and nipped a minuscule piece of Sun in her
beak. On the way back home, the tiny bit flew out of her beak and
landed on her head. That’s why the eagle has a bald spot on the top
of its head.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Spider
volunteered next. She took a clay pot with her and climbed slowly up
into the sky, her web trailing behind her. When she reached Sun, she
trapped a bit of him in her pot and quickly closed the lid. Then she
wrapped the pot in silky threads so that it would not burn her. When
she returned to her friends, everyone rejoiced, for now they had fire
and heat!</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Sun
became angry when he realized he had lost his fire to Spider, and so
he set off to find her. He began traveling around the world from east
to west, searching for Spider. The animals were delighted by Sun’s
movement, for now they could enjoy regular periods of light and heat.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Sun
never found Spider because she hid beneath a rock each time he shone
overhead. Before long, Sun forgot all about Spider but continued
traveling around Earth, making almost exactly the same trip every
day.</font></font></p>
