Hawaiian Monk Seals</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Marine
animal experts are on a mission. They want to save Hawaiian monk
seals from becoming extinct. Extinct means &quot;no longer existing.&quot;
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Today,
about 1,200 seals live near the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
Experts fear that the population will drop in the next five years.
&quot;The clock is ticking,&quot; says scientist Jen Palmer.</p>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Experts
worry that the seals are not getting enough food. Many of the pups
are thin and are not living past their first few years. Scientists
are trying to figure out why.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Other
scientists are monitoring the monk sealsâ€™ habitat for pollution. A
habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives. &quot;Every
person takes a very tiny bit of the puzzle, and you hope at some
point you...put it all together and it makes a pretty clear picture,&quot;
says scientist Charles Littnan.</p>
