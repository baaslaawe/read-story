Journal</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">June 17</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Okay, so my mom is
the captain of a tall ship, and I’m finally allowed to sail with
her to find out what she does when she goes away. Dad takes good care
of us kids at home, but I do wonder why Mom loves being at sea. We
left Bermuda today and are heading toward Canada. We’re sailing on
a 135-foot boat called a brigantine, but what’s special about being
on a boat that weighs 158 tons? Anyway, I don’t feel that great.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">June 19</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I’m so sick. Mom
says that I won’t be seasick once I get my sea legs, but it’s
been two days now and I feel awful. The ship goes up and down and
rocks from side to side, and it goes forward. That’s a lot of
movement! All I can eat is peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">June 20</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I must finally have
my sea legs because I don’t feel sick today. The first mate let me
climb up to the crow’s nest, and I could see for miles. But the
only thing I saw was water!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">June 21</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There are several
scientists on the boat conducting experiments. Last night we cast a
large net and skimmed the water as we moved along, capturing tiny
zooplankton. Zooplankton glow in the dark, so they lit up the outline
of the net. It was fascinating. This morning we studied some plankton
under a microscope. Plankton are so small you can’t see them with
the naked eye.<br/>
June 23</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Today I learned how
to coil rope in three overlapping circles, almost like a sculpture!
Coiling the rope makes it easy to get when the sailors need it. This
morning we saw basking sharks swimming beside us, apparently eating
the plankton. They are giants but are harmless. Then later we watched
some dolphins as they escorted the ship for over an hour! They swam
right beside the ship, jumping in and out of the water.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">June 25</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Land ho! We’re
back to reality today. I have learned a lot about sea creatures, the
ocean, and tall ships, but most of all I learned that Mom loves
sailing because it’s so much fun!
