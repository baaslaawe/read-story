I leave my house around 7:00 in the morning. My first class starts

have choir and dance rehearsal from 2:30 until 6:30. I get home

I've been with the choir for two years. I play the trumpet and piano.
But I prefer singing. Your voice is an instrument that you can play
anywhere.</p>

It is quite an experience. We've done a lot of shows to support the
families of the victims. I feel connected to the families. Singing at
these services has taught me to value the little things you get in
life. I think the choir has helped the families heal.</p>

The choir performs all over the country and the world. We just sang

hard at singing. I put a lot of time and effort into the choir. Not
many kids get to do what I do.</p>

What is your favorite song to perform? Anthony: I like singing &quot;We
Shall Overcome.&quot; It is a song that brings people together. I can
connect with people while we're singing. It's really touching to see
and hear people come together.
