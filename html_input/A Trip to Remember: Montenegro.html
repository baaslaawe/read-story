Trip to Remember: Montenegro</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
family is from Montenegro (mahn-tehNEH-groh), a tiny country in
Europe. It is on the Adriatic (ay-dree-A-tik) Sea across from Italy.
Three years ago, when I was eight, I went there for the first time. I
had no friends there so I did not have such a good time. This past
summer, though, I went back and had a blast. I guess it is because I
understood more about my family’s roots. I got a better feel for my
family’s Albanian heritage. Also, I got to connect with my family.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
stayed in a house right next to the beach. This is a special place.
My father built the house with his brother and father. He was so
proud and happy, showing me all the work he did. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
house is in the city of Ulcinj (OULchin). It has a beach that is
twelve miles long. It is a resort town, so there was lots to do:
swimming, waterslides, suntanning. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Yet the
most fun was a volleyball game that my dad, sister, and I made up.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Since
we were on vacation, we ate in some restaurants. But the best meal
was when my mom cooked “glush.” This is a typical Albanian meal
of meat, peas, and mashed potatoes. I don’t know why it tasted
better there. My mom said it is because the food is fresher.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
visited with aunts, uncles, and cousins. I also met some new
relatives.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
listened to Albanian folk songs and cracked jokes about our culture.
The adults talked about their country and the good old days. I
learned that when my father was a teenager, and even older, he made a
living selling watermelon to people on the beach.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
visited, in a way, with some other relatives I had never met: my
grandparents. My dad took me to their graves. He cried. I cried, too.
I was sad because they died before I was born.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My dad
and I spent a lot of time together on that trip. We swam and ate in
local restaurants. He took me to a famous spa. Most of all, we
talked. At home, we don’t have much time together. During our trip,
I found that I could talk to him about anything.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Now,
when I think of Montenegro, all I can say is, “O! sah ven ee
BOOK-oor,” which means, “What a wonderful place!”</p>
