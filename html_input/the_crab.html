<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Saturday
was supposed to be a </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>gloomy</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
day, but when I woke up the sun was shining and there wasn’t a
cloud in the sky. “What a great day to go the beach,” I thought.
I invited Rebecca to come with me, but instead of being </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>ecstatic</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
about going to the beach, she was unenthusiastic and decided to stay
home. Next, I called my cousin Miguel, who was eager to go to the
beach.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">We
arrived at the beach and laid out our towels and beach chairs. Miguel
saw a crab in the sand and he walked over to it. I thought it would
</font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>scurry</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
away, but the crab stayed where it was. It wasn’t afraid of Miguel
at all! At first I pretended I wasn’t interested, but I was </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>curious</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
about the crab. Finally, I walked over to Miguel and the crab.
“Miguel, that crab is sick. It needs to go back into the water. You
need to pick it up and take it into the ocean right now!”</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
thought that Miguel would </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>complain</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
about having to pick up the crab, but he happily took the crab back
down to the ocean. We both watched the crab to see what would happen.
I was not sure if the crab would be okay. I tried to relax, but I was
feeling very </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>anxious</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">.
Miguel told me that although this was a new thing for me, he was very
</font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>familiar</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
with crabs and he was not worried about the crab at all. He told me
to stop being so </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>impatient</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">.
The crab just needed some time to feel better before he swam away.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Miguel
was right! After a few minutes, the tiny crab began to swim away. I
was delighted! This turned out to be a </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>splendid</b></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">
day at the beach instead of a boring day at home.</font></p>
