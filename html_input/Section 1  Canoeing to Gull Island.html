1:  Canoeing to Gull Island 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 	Tim Turner sat on
the bench at the front and put on his life jacket. His father settled
in the back before passing Tim an oar. Thin clouds filled the sky. A
gentle breeze rippled across Crystal Lake. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 	Tim knelt down in
front of the bench as they set off for Gull Island. The island was
about a half-hour away by canoe. Tim’s family often canoed to Gull
Island in August to collect blueberries. Tim and his father fell into
an easy rhythm. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 	But soon the wind
picked up and the sun disappeared behind thickening clouds. Waves
splashed into the canoe. “Do you think we should turn back?” Tim
asked. “It looks like it’s going to rain any minute now.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 	“I wouldn’t
worry, son,” his father said. “The weather forecast said no rain,
just a mix of clouds and sunshine.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 	“They sure got
the clouds part right,” Tim said. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 	Within a few
minutes, Tim and his father were pulling the canoe onto a small beach
at Gull Island. Tim looked across the lake. The lake and the sky were
both inky black.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 	They grabbed
their buckets and hurried to the blueberry patch. The bushes were
always packed with berries in August. Before long, their buckets were
full of plump, sweet blueberries. Tim took a small handful and ate
them. “Good?” his father asked. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 	“The best
blueberries in New Hampshire, as always,” Tim said. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 	“I only wish we
could stay and eat them with our lunch,” Tim’s father said. “But
I think you’re right about the rain. We’d better get going fast
and eat later.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 	They raced for
the beach, put on their life jackets, pushed the canoe into the
water, and scrambled in. Then they started paddling like two racers.
The canoe zipped across the wavy lake. Usually the trip took 30
minutes, but today they were back in half that time. “I think we
set a new world record,” Tim’s father gasped as he caught his
breath. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 	They loaded up
the car with the canoe and the berries. The minute Tim’s father
turned on the engine, heavy rain began to pelt the car. “Do you
know the best thing to do when it’s raining?” Tim’s father
asked. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">12 	Tim knew the
answer to his father’s little joke. “Let it rain!” Tim shouted.</p>
