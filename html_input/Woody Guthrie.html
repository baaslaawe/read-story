Guthrie</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 Woody Guthrie
wanted to make the world a fairer place. During his life, he wrote
about 3,000 songs. He used his songs to get across his message about
justice and fairness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Woodrow Wilson
Guthrie was born in Oklahoma in 1912. His family went through some
good times, but mostly they struggled. Often they lived in a shack.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Before he turned
20, Guthrie moved to Texas. There, he married and started a family.
He also formed a band.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 The 1930s were
hard for many families. The country was going through a depression.
Millions of people did not have jobs. The Great Dust Storm had ruined
many farms. Guthrie headed for California, looking for work. He
hopped trains, hitchhiked, and even walked.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 In California,
Guthrie landed a radio job. At first he sang mostly traditional
songs, which made him popular. Soon, Guthrie began singing folk songs
about underdogs. Poor people, farmworkers, and unemployed people
became his subjects. One of his most popular songs says, “This land
is your land, this land is my land . . . this land was made for you
and me.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Woody Guthrie
never stayed in one place for long. In 1940, he moved across the
country. He joined other singers in New York City who shared his
ideas about fairness. Music was their way of fighting for justice and
workers’ rights. They wanted their music to inspire people to
change the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 Soon Guthrie was
on the road again. He moved west with his family and then back east.
During his travels, he never stopped writing songs, poems, and even
novels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 When the United
States went to war in 1941, Guthrie joined the army. He wrote
hundreds of songs, which helped to rally American troops during World
War II.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 By 1950, Woody
Guthrie started showing signs of sickness. His moods changed rapidly,
and he could become violent. At first, nobody knew what was wrong.
Finally, doctors realized that he had a terrible disease. He spent
the last years of his life in hospitals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 Woody Guthrie’s
songs continue to stir strong feelings. His songs have roused people
to fight for fairness and justice. They have made many people feel
more hopeful about their lives. “I am out to sing the songs that
make you take pride in yourself and in your work,” he once said.</p>
