2:  Annie’s Hike 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 	Annie Dobbs moved
along the trail up Pine Ridge Mountain. She was a careful, steady
hiker, though not especially fast. Annie’s friends from Backpack
Camp were at least 25 yards ahead of her with Ms. Simms. Annie and
Ms. Lynn, the other leader from camp, were bringing up the rear. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 	A little while
later, Annie heard her best friend, Gina Poole, talking and laughing
with some other girls and began to feel left out. She pushed herself
to walk faster and catch up. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 	“Don’t worry,
Annie,” Ms. Lynn said, as if she’d read Annie’s mind. “I
predict you’ll be one of the first hikers to reach the top of Pine
Ridge.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 	Ms. Lynn’s
comforting words made Annie feel better. She decided to slow down and
hike at her own pace. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 	Annie started
paying more attention to the beautiful mountain trail. She noticed
expanses of yellow, white, and purple wildflowers in sunny fields off
the path. A snake slithered along the edge of the trail and
disappeared under a fallen log. A gray squirrel slipped into a hole
in an old oak as a hawk swooped toward the tree. Annie felt as if she
had entered a secret world. It wasn’t so bad to be at the back of
the line, after all. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 	Before long,
Annie realized that the other hikers had stopped their chattering and
laughing. Maybe they were observing the plants and animals along the
trail, too. Annie passed Laura Dean, who had been far ahead of her
all morning. “I’m exhausted,” Laura told Ms. Lynn. “So I’ll
hike with you and Annie for a while.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 	But Annie wasn’t
tired at all. She left Laura Dean in the rear with Ms. Lynn. Soon she
saw Gina and the other hikers, only a short distance ahead of her
now. They were creeping along the path. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 	A few minutes
later, Annie passed Gina and the other hikers and joined Ms. Simms
for the last leg of the trail. Annie and Ms. Simms reached their
destination, the lookout on Pine Ridge, with no one else in sight. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 	Annie sat down
and looked out across the horizon. She could see the Scott River
winding slowly but steadily through Oak Dale toward her hometown.
“Slow and steady,” Annie thought. “That’s the way to go.”</p>
