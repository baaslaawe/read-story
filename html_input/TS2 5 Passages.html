and ice cream bars are both cold, refreshing treats to have on hot
days. They are both served on a stick and they need to be stored in
the freezer. Both melt quickly when they are being eaten. However,
there are some differences between the popsicle and ice cream bar, as
well. Popsicles are made primarily of water, while ice cream bars
have creamy ice cream in the middle. Popsicles usually come in fruity
flavors, whereas ice cream bars usually have a chocolate coating
surrounding the ice cream. As you can see, popsicles and ice cream
bars at similar in many ways, but there are also some important
differences between the two tasty treats.</span></font></font></font></p>

of people around the world have trouble getting to sleep at night. In
fact, one in three people report having this problem. If you are one
of these people, there are things you can do to get a good night’s
sleep. First, doctors recommend that you go to bed and get up at the
same time every night, including weekends. Keep the same routine
every night at bedtime. Another solution is to avoid eating or
drinking foods with caffeine. Coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate are
often high in caffeine and should be avoided. Also, do not exercise
within three hours of bedtime. Try to do something relaxing before
heading to bed. Avoid watching scary or intense television programs,
and do not think about stressful events. These are just a few ideas
that can help you get a complete night of sleep.</span></font></font></font></p>

you drink enough water each day? The average person should drink
eight to ten glasses of water a day- even more if you are athletic.
It is important to drink water each day for several reasons. People
who do not drink enough water gain weight and have excess body fat as
a result. They also have poor muscle tone, muscle soreness, and joint
pain which may be due to not drinking enough water. The brain needs
water in order to think and solve problems. Consequently, students
who don’t drink enough water tend to have trouble focusing in
school. The digestive system does not work properly without enough
water, as well. All parts of the body work better when a person
drinks the correct amount of water each day.</span></font></font></font></p>

Kingda Ka, a tiger-themed roller coaster, is the tallest coaster in
the world. It is located at Six Flags Great Adventure Amusement Park
in Jackson, New Jersey. It reaches 456 feet in the air. It is also
the world’s second fastest roller coaster. Specifically, it can
reach a speed of 128 miles per hour. It was completed in 2005. The
ride lasts 28 seconds from start to finish. Thrill seekers enjoy the
lightning fast speed (it goes from 0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5
seconds) and a 418 foot drop. In addition, riders enjoy the moment of
weightlessness that occurs near the end of the ride.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>

properly care for your teeth, you need to follow these instructions.
First, put toothpaste on your toothbrush. Begin by brushing the outer
and inner surfaces of your teeth. Brush these parts by holding your
toothbrush at a 45 degree angle and do short brushing strokes against
the gum line. Next, move on to the chewing surfaces. Hold the brush
flat and brush back and forth. Then, brush the inside surfaces of
your front teeth. Tilt your toothbrush vertically and brush gently up
and down. Finally, brush your tongue in a back-to-front motion.
Dentists recommend that you spend two minutes brushing your teeth,
and that you do it twice a day.</span></span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
