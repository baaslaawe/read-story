<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Passage 1</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Popsicles and ice
cream bars are both cold, refreshing treats to have on hot days. They
are both served on a stick and they need to be stored in the freezer.
Both melt quickly when they are being eaten. However, there are some
differences between the popsicle and ice cream bar, as well.
Popsicles are made primarily of water, as opposed to ice cream bars
which have creamy ice cream in the middle. Popsicles usually come in
fruity flavors, whereas ice cream bars usually have a chocolate
coating surrounding the ice cream. As you can see, popsicles and ice
cream bars at similar in many ways, but there are also some important
differences between the two tasty treats.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Passage 2</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Millions of people
around the world have trouble getting to sleep at night. In fact, one
in three people report having this problem. If you are one of these
people, there are things you can do to get a good night’s sleep.
First, doctors recommend that you go to bed and get up at the same
time every day, including weekends. Keep the same routine every night
at bedtime. Another solution is to avoid eating or drinking foods
with caffeine. Coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate are often high in
caffeine and can lead to loss of sleep. Watching scary or intense
television programs, or thinking about stressful events can also lead
to trouble sleeping. Exercising within three hours of bedtime can
also reduce chances of falling asleep. Therefore, try to do something
relaxing before heading to bed. These are just a few ideas that can
help you get a complete night of sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Passage 3</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	The Kingda Ka, a
tiger-themed roller coaster, is the tallest coaster in the world. For
instance, it reaches 456 feet in the air. It is located at Six Flags
Great Adventure Amusement Park in Jackson, New Jersey. It is also the
world’s second fastest roller coaster. Specifically, it can reach a
speed of 128 miles per hour. It was completed in 2005. The ride lasts
28 seconds from start to finish. Thrill seekers enjoy the lightning
fast speed (it goes from 0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds) and
a 418 foot drop. In addition, riders enjoy the moment of
weightlessness that occurs near the end of the ride.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Passage 4</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Do you drink enough
water each day? The average person should drink eight to ten glasses
of water a day- even more if you are athletic. It is important to
drink water each day for several reasons. People who do not drink
enough water gain weight and have excess body fat as a result. They
also have poor muscle tone, muscle soreness, and joint pain which may
be due to not drinking enough water. The brain needs water in order
to think and answer questions. Consequently, students who don’t
drink enough water tend to have trouble focusing in school. The
digestive system does not work properly without enough water, as
well. All parts of the body work better when a person drinks the
correct amount of water each day.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Passage 5</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	To properly care
for your teeth, you need to follow these instructions. First, put
toothpaste on your toothbrush. Begin by brushing the outer and inner
surfaces of your teeth. Brush these parts by holding your toothbrush
at a 45 degree angle and do short brushing strokes against the gum
line. Next, move on to the chewing surfaces. Hold the brush flat and
brush back and forth. Then, brush the inside surfaces of your front
teeth. Tilt your toothbrush vertically and brush gently up and down.
Finally, brush your tongue in a back-to-front motion. Dentists
recommend that you spend two minutes brushing your teeth, and that
you do it twice a day.</p>
