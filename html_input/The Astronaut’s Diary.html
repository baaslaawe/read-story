<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Astronaut’s Diary</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We were exhausted
from all the work. We slept in shifts. One of us had to be awake all
the time. There was so much work to do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Finally, we got to
our destination. We had reached the space station. There, we would do
more work, but we would have less pressure. We had so much to do
every day on our ship. Now there would be more people to help us. We
would be on a collaborative team. We would be able to share the work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When we moved into
the space station, I felt great. There was so much more space. We
would have real beds to sleep in. We would have better food. They had
a garden on the space station. They grew vegetables.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The six astronauts
on the space station were happy to see us. They said, “We have been
waiting for you.” We were glad to see them, too. We had been
worried. We heard that one of them had been sick.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We asked how she was
feeling. She said she was better now. It had been a cold. We were
relieved. We could stop worrying now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">That first night on
the space station was great. We had good food. We had a good dinner.
Then we were going to sleep. But one of the astronauts said, “We
need to give you a job. Each person has to take turns staying awake.
Here is the schedule.” So I had a shift again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I saw I was first. I
would have to stay awake tonight. I was disappointed. I felt
fatigued. I had been awake and working for 20 hours. But I knew it
was my duty. So I sighed and said, “See you in the morning.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I became an
astronaut so that I could travel in space. Now I’m here. It is hard
work. It’s even more challenging than I expected.</p>
