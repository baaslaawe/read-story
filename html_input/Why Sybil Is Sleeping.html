<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Why
Sybil Is Sleeping</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 “Mama, why isn't
Sybil up yet? I need her help practicing my numbers so that Teacher
doesn't yell at me,” said Derick.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 “I need her to
button my shoes,” said Henry.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 “And she always
brushes my hair before breakfast!” complained Mary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Baby Abigail
didn't say anything. She just peeked under the furniture in search of
her missing sister.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 The six younger
Ludington children all depended on their oldest sister. So did their
mother. “Sybil is sleeping,” she said quietly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 “Sleeping!”
said Mary. “Sybil never sleeps this late!”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 It was true. When
Sybil wasn't helping her mother with the other children, she kept
busy cooking and cleaning. She washed and mended clothes and did
other tasks around the house. Perhaps it was good that the Ludington
girls could not attend school as their brothers did. Many of Sybil's
chores would go undone.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 In fact, Sybil's
father depended on her as well. He was a leader of the Revolutionary
Army in New York. As a result, Colonel Ludington was wanted by the
British. There was a reward for his arrest. Some time ago, a British
sympathizer had tried to capture the colonel in his home. Sybil and
her younger sister Rebecca were keeping watch that night, armed with
pistols. The girls gave the alarm. Right away, the family lit candles
and paraded back and forth in front of the windows. To a stranger, it
looked like many, many people were inside, protecting the colonel.
The attacker gave up and went away.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 Mrs. Ludington
softly explained why Sybil was still not awake this morning. “Last
night when Sybil was putting you to bed, a messenger came to see your
father. He said that the British soldiers had just attacked Danbury.
Father needed to gather soldiers to fight the British. It was not
safe to go himself. Sybil offered to go. She spent the whole night on
horseback, alerting the soldiers. She rode all around the county. She
traveled forty miles in the cold, rainy night.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 “Mama, look!”
Young Henry pointed out the window. Four hundred soldiers had
gathered on the Ludingtons' lawn under the rising sun.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 Mrs. Ludington
looked outside where her husband paced in front of the soldiers.
Sybil had made her family proud once again.
