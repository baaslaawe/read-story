Two Wheeled Beginner</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 “Carmen, I have
a surprise for you,” said Mr. Vargas. He beamed as he rolled a
dented two-wheeler out of the shed behind their building.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Carmen tried to
look excited. “Gee, thanks, Mr. Vargas,” she said. She didn’t
move an inch toward the bicycle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 The old man said,
“I know it’s a little rusted and a little beatup. My Miguel used
to ride it. I found it when I cleaned up the shed. Give it a try.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Carmen could not
figure out a way to seem grateful. “Um, I can’t,” she
stammered.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 Mr. Vargas’s
eyebrows shot up. “It’s not good enough for you?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Now Carmen was
really embarrassed. “No, it’s just that I . . . I never had a
bike before. I never learned how to ride.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 “Aw, that’s
all? Come, I’ll show you.” The old man would not take no for an
answer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 Carmen glanced up
and down the block. “Um, Mr. Vargas, do you mind if we try it
behind the building?” she asked. Her friends from school might be
passing by at any time. She was the only third grader she knew who
couldn’t ride a bike. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 For the next two
days, Mr. Vargas held onto the back of the bike as Carmen wobbled
around the parking lot. On the third day, he let go. Carmen pedaled
smoothly around the lot. She turned and rode back to where she began.
“Thank you so much, Mr. Vargas!” she said with a grin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 Carmen pedaled
around to the front of the building. Just then Dana and Kelly were
riding past on their bikes. “Carmen, come join us!” they shouted.
11 Carmen turned back to look at Mr. Vargas. He held one thumb up and
nodded. Carmen raced to catch up with her friends.
