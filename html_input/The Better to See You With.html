<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Better to See You With</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 “Just keep your
eye on the ball.” Uncle Chet’s words echoed in Doug’s head.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Whifff! Doug swung
the bat and missed the ball, again. This was getting ridiculous. His
cheeks felt hot as he walked to the bench. No wonder he always got
picked last for the team.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 As he lined up
after recess, Doug wondered, How come other kids could hit a
baseball? Why could they find the hoop with a basketball? Why didn’t
other kids say the wrong words when it was their turn to read out
loud? Did other people see the world differently?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Once or twice,
other people had suggested that maybe he needed glasses. No way, Doug
had always thought. He wanted to avoid giving his brother’s friends
one more thing to taunt him about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 That afternoon Mr.
Greene called on Doug to read the next math problem. Doug squinted at
the numbers on the board. As he read the problem, the other kids
started to giggle. After class, Mr. Greene took Doug aside. “I
think you need to get your eyes checked,” he said. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Doug mumbled to
himself, “One more thing. Just one more thing to get teased about.
Okay, I give up.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 A few days later,
Doug pulled out his new glasses. He slid them on, hoping no one would
notice, just as math class began.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 “Doug, please
read the first problem,” said Mr. Greene.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 Doug read the
problem aloud and solved it. Phew! he thought.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 That afternoon,
his brother’s friends came over to play basketball. No one said a
word about Doug’s glasses. Al said, “We need another guy to even
up the teams. Do you want to play?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 Doug nodded
nervously. Then, when it was his turn, he bounced the ball. He kept
his eyes on the ball and on the hoop, took a breath, and shot. Two
points! Hey! he thought as Al gave him a high five, maybe this won’t
be so bad after all.
