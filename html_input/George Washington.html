<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">George
Washington</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Only one person in
the history of the United States is known as the “Father of Our
Country.” That person is George Washington. Few people have ever
served their country as well as George Washington. He was a soldier,
a general, and a leader. He was the first president of a new country.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Life in Virginia</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">George Washington
was born on a large farm in Virginia on February 22, 1732. As a boy,
George loved the open fields and mysterious forests. He liked to hunt
and to ride horses. He liked to farm the fertile land of his home.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When he was a young
man, George became a surveyor. He measured land and made maps. He
went deep into the wilderness of Virginia. He camped and learned to
take care of himself in dangerous situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When George was just
twenty-one years old, he became a soldier. He fought with the British
against the French. George proved himself to be a strong leader. He
earned a promotion to colonel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In 1759, George
married. He and his wife Martha settled down to a quiet life. They
lived on a spacious farm called Mount Vernon. He filled his days by
running the farm, hunting, fishing, and helping to raise Martha’s
two children. But these happy and peaceful times did not last. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Revolution!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">By 1775, there were
thirteen colonies. The people who lived in the colonies followed laws
made by the British king, George III. They paid taxes to Britain. The
colonists wanted to choose their own leaders and make their own laws.
They wanted to make their own decisions about taxes. They wanted
their own government.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Leaders from the
colonies met in Philadelphia to talk about what to do. These leaders
made an important decision: They would separate from Britain. They
would fight for freedom if they had to. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In April 1775, the
colonies went to war with Britain. To fight, they had to form an
army. They chose George Washington to lead it. He was forty-three
years old. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Leader in War</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Washington had been
a hero in the French and Indian War twenty years earlier. Now he
would fight against the British as General George Washington. Few
generals ever faced a greater challenge. The British had the
strongest army and the biggest navy in the world. How could thirteen
small colonies defeat them? 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The revolution was
long and bloody. Most of Washington’s soldiers had little training.
Washington sometimes had no money to pay them. Supplies were short.
It was often hard to get food. How did a small, poorly trained army
fight the awesome military power of Britain? They had Washington as
their leader!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">To build a better
army, Washington used the skills he developed in the wilderness of
Virginia. He taught his men to travel light and to move quickly and
quietly. He showed them how to hide in the woods. He made surprise
attacks on the enemy. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Washington’s men
loved him and would do anything for him. He did not let them give up
and he did not give up himself. He begged for supplies for his men.
He once wrote that the men had “not even the shadow of a blanket”
to keep warm in the bitter cold. The British had a large army, but
the United States had George Washington.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At first,
Washington’s army suffered many defeats. Holding his men together
was difficult. During the terrible winter of 1777, Washington and his
soldiers camped in the icy snow at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Many
soldiers had no shoes or warm clothing. They were hungry. Even
Washington grew discouraged. “I am wearied almost to death,” he
wrote. Many of his soldiers were ready to give up and leave for home.
But Washington and his soldiers stayed to fight on. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In 1781, after six
years of fighting, the colonies won their freedom. The United States
of America was born.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A New Leader for a
New Country</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Washington said that
the only reward he wanted for his hard work was the “affection of a
free people.” He returned to a quiet life at Mount Vernon. He
expected to spend the rest of his days there. But again his peaceful
farming life did not last. His country was forging a new nation. The
country needed a leader with courage and strength. The people wanted
someone with common sense and experience. Washington was the ideal
choice. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The United States
was a new country with a new set of laws. The people had a new way of
governing. Instead of having a king, they would vote for a leader.
Washington was the one man everyone trusted to get the new government
started. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Liberty, when it
begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth,” he wrote to James
Madison in March 1788. Washington won the election and became
president of the new nation. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On April 30, 1789,
George Washington stood on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York
City. It was a cloudless day. Thousands of people lined the narrow
streets. They cheered and tossed flower petals. Cannons boomed.
Washington placed his hand on a Bible and repeated an oath of office.
He promised to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of
the United States.” He was the first person to make this promise. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Washington was
president for a term of four years. Then he served for a second term.
He proved that a president chosen by the people could be a good
leader. He worked to make the new nation strong. During his time in
office, five new states joined the Union. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">He made new laws for
the new country. He signed treaties, or agreements, with other
countries. He helped the states work together as one government. He
kept the nation out of war. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Home Again 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When he left office,
Washington returned to his beloved home. After the excitement of war
and the presidency, he was glad to enjoy the peaceful life of Mount
Vernon again. He often told people that he liked to be thought of as
the “nation’s first farmer.” He died at Mount Vernon on
December 14, 1799. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">George Washington
was born to a simple, quiet life. He led his country through a long
and dangerous war. He guided it through the early years of freedom.
When he died, the following words were spoken about him in a speech
delivered before Congress by General Henry Lee: “He was first in
war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”</p>
