<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9. Look at the title
of the passage and take a quick look at the first paragraph. What
questions do you have? Write two questions you have that will help
you understand the passage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Louis
Pasteur</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 Did you ever taste
sour milk? Long ago, milk turned sour a lot faster than it does now.
That’s partly because most milk is pasteurized today. First it is
heated. Then it is cooled. This process kills bacteria, which are
tiny germs in the milk. Those germs are what make milk go bad. The
process is named for the person who invented it, Louis Pasteur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 This French
scientist made many other important discoveries, too. In the 1800s,
some people used silkworms to produce silk. Many silkworms in France
were dying. Pasteur figured out what was making them die. He was able
to save the French silk industry. He also used what he learned about
germs to understand other diseases.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Pasteur wanted to
know how diseases spread from one farm animal to another. He did many
experiments. He spread germs from one sheep to another to understand
diseases. He did this with chickens, too. By accident, he figured out
something important. If animals got just a few germs, or a mild
illness, they could fight off the disease later on. This was the
first step in creating vaccines.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Pasteur also
wanted to know why some people got sicker in a hospital. He had a
theory that germs came from outside the body. At first, other
scientists did not agree with him. They did not believe that
something tiny could harm something as big as a person. Pasteur
proved that bacteria and other germs cause many diseases. His work
led doctors to wash their hands before surgery. This practice saved
many lives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 Perhaps no one was
more thankful for Pasteur’s work than Joseph Meister. A dog bit
nine-year-old Joseph in 1885. The dog was sick with a disease called
rabies. His mother carried the injured boy to see Pasteur. She knew
that the scientist was experimenting with rabies vaccines. They
contained the virus, or germs, from rabies. Pasteur had never tested
a vaccine on humans. Was it safe to give it to the boy? Pasteur
decided that Joseph would die without the vaccine. Thanks to his bold
experiment, Joseph survived.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Pasteur’s work
ranged from spoiled milk to sick silkworms. He prevented diseases in
people and animals. Pasteur combined a creative side with a
scientific mind. His work made life safer for people of the future.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10. In “Louis
Pasteur,” what is the meaning of the word theory in paragraph 4?</p>

experiment</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">12. What could be
another good title for this passage?</p>

Invented Vaccines”</p>
