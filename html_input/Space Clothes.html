Clothes</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">What do astronauts
wear in space, where the environment is so different from Earth? In
space, there is no oxygen and no air pressure. Also, space is either
extremely hot or extremely cold. The clothes astronauts wear must
protect them from these dangerous conditions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Inside and Outside
the Shuttle</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Inside the space
shuttle, astronauts can wear ordinary, comfortable clothes. Outside
the shuttle, however, they must wear special suits called EMUs. EMU
stands for Extravehicular Mobility Unit. EMUs protect astronauts
while they do their jobs outside the shuttle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Putting on the Suit</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">An EMU has many
parts. First, an astronaut puts on a full body suit that keeps him or
her cool. Then, the astronaut puts on a protective top and bottom.
The last things the astronaut puts on are the gloves and helmet. Now
it’s time to put on the most important piece – the backpack!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Space Survival</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The backpack
contains the Primary Life Support System, which helps astronauts
breathe in space. It also allows them to communicate with the other
astronauts. Without their special clothing and equipment astronauts
could not survive or do their job.</p>
