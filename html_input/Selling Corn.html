<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Selling
Corn</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Roy lived on a farm.
He liked to help his mom and dad with chores. Roy fed the animals,
and even had his own small patch of corn to tend.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Roy’s best friend
was Luis. “Let’s join the football team this fall,” said Luis.
“It costs ten dollars to sign up.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“I don’t have
ten dollars,” said Roy. Then he grinned. “I know! I can sell some
of my corn! I can make ten dollars in no time at all.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Roy told his mom and
dad his plan. They told Roy that his plan was a good idea.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Roy picked his corn.
He set up a stand in front of the farm. People stopped by and bought
corn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The next day, Roy
sent Luis an e-mail. “I can join the team now!” he said.</p>
