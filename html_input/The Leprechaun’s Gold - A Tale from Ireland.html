Leprechaun’s Gold - A Tale from Ireland</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 ’Twas a fine,
sunny morning when young Finn Smith went to work in the field. Just
as he was about to begin his work, Finn heard a strange sound coming
from the row next to him. “Tic-tac-too, tic-tac-too,” went the
sound.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Happy for any
excuse to delay working, Finn put down his shovel and crept quietly
down the row. The tapping sound became louder and louder. Soon, Finn
saw a little old man sitting at a tiny workbench hammering away at a
shoe that sparkled in the sun. Finn knew he was looking at a
leprechaun. He also knew that the trick to capturing a fairy or
leprechaun was never to look away from it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Finn kept his eyes
on the old man and quietly greeted him.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 “Good day,”
Finn said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 “Good day to
you, too,” smiled the little old man. Then he lifted up a spoon and
asked, “Would you like some of my porridge?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Finn could see out
of the corner of his eye the many beautiful colors in the bowl. He
was curious and wanted to look at it, but he kept his eyes on the old
man.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 “No, thank you,”
said Finn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 The old man
continued to try to trick Finn into looking away, but Finn continued
to stare. Finally, Finn demanded, “Bring me to where a pot of gold
lies.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 The leprechaun
thought for a bit and then said, “I will show you where the gold
is, but then you must let me leave. I need to make more shoes for the
dance tonight.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 Finn agreed, and
so the leprechaun led Finn through streams and woods until they
finally reached a field of dandelions. The leprechaun pointed to one
of the dandelions. “The gold is under that one,” he said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 “Swear on your
honor that the pot is under there,” said Finn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">12 The leprechaun
swore, and Finn let the old man leave.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">13 Finn needed a
shovel to dig for the gold. He took off one of his socks and put it
over the dandelion. Then he ran to get his shovel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">14 When Finn
returned to the field, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Every
dandelion had a sock on it that looked exactly like Finn’s. He
would never find the right one. As Finn turned to go home, he was
sure he heard hundreds of dandelions laughing at him.</p>
