<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Inuit Keep Their Traditions Alive</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Listen, children.
Listen to the beat of the drum.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Inuit elder Sara
Olanna starts to play a flat, caribou skin drum. Her husband, Joseph,
begins to dance. He is wearing a wooden mask painted to look like a
seal. And though he is in his eighties, he moves gracefully. He moves
just like a swimming seal. As he dances, Sara sings. Her song thanks
the seal for its meat and fur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It’s a special day
for the Inuit children in Tanalipaq Public School. They are getting
their first lesson in drum dancing. It’s one of the oldest Inuit
traditions, about 5,000 years old. People like Sara and Joseph want
to keep Inuit culture alive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">And the children are
eager to learn. To them, it is a part of their past they have heard
about only in stories. But today, that past is coming alive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Like any modern-day
people, the Inuit of the Canadian Yukon shop in stores and
supermarkets. They use trucks, cars, powerboats, and snowmobiles to
get around. They live in wood and concrete houses. They watch
television and listen to the radio. They read books and use
computers. But they also remember their past. They honor their
history through dancing, singing, storytelling, and art.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Less than 100 years
ago, the Inuit were still living the same way they had lived for
centuries. Proud of their traditional ways, they had also given
themselves the name “Inuit,” which means “the people.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Long ago, the Inuit
had learned how to survive in the harshest climate. They tamed wild
dogs and used them to pull sleds through the snow. In the spring and
summer, they lived by inland rivers, where they fished for salmon.
They hunted deer and caribou. They picked berries. In the autumn,
they traveled to the coast. They used kayaks and large canoes to hunt
whales, walruses, and seals. They dried the meat and fish so that
they could have food through the long, dark, winter months.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The Inuit would live
in different houses, depending on the seasons. In the spring and
summer, they lived in tents made of wooden poles covered with caribou
and deer skins. In the autumn and winter, they lived in underground
homes by the sea. The homes were covered with mossy dirt, or sod.
They slept on wooden boards covered with sealskins. They wore seal
fur clothes and boots. And when they went hunting for seals and polar
bears out on the ice, they built temporary houses called igloos. The
igloos were made out of large blocks of ice and had rounded,
dome-like roofs. Tunnel-like doorways were made by cutting openings
in the thick ice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During the long
winter from November to March, it was too dark and dangerous to hunt
or fish. So the Inuit stayed inside. They spent the time sewing
clothes and making hunting spears. They carved animals and made
jewelry out of wood, metal, stone, and whalebone. They made painted
wooden masks and animal-skin drums. And they told stories to the
children. They told stories about how Earth was created. They told
stories about past hunting adventures. The Inuit elders told the
children tales about their ancestors. And the elders sang and danced.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">For thousands of
years, the Inuit handed down their stories, songs, and dances to
their children. And their children did the same thing. But in the
1800s and 1900s, the Inuit began to lose their connection with their
culture. Christian missionaries, European fur traders, and American
gold miners began to settle in the Yukon. They brought their own ways
of life. Often, the Inuit were forced to give up their own language,
traditions, and beliefs. Today, they still do some traditional
hunting and fishing. But they also learned to hunt with guns, drive
snowmobiles, and live in permanent houses.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Fortunately, a
movement has grown among the Inuit to reclaim their past. Inuit
public school children learn their native language, Inuktitut, along
with English. They hold ceremonies that celebrate the seasons. And,
like the children of Tanalipaq, they learn from their elders how to
drum dance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Now, children,
you dance, too,” says Joseph Olanna. He holds out his arms. One by
one, the children join him as Sara beats the drum and sings. Once
again, the Inuit culture’s most glorious past will live on in the
Inuit people’s future.</p>
