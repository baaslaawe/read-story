<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Spinning
Bees and Liberty Tea</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 “Mother, I would
give anything for a proper cup of tea. Please tell me why we cannot
have it anymore,” said Sarah as she set the table. Mrs. Addams
boiled water to make hot tea from berry leaves instead of tea leaves.
A group of ladies would arrive any minute.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Mrs. Addams said,
“The American patriots dumped British tea into Boston Harbor last
December. We will not drink British tea in this house. That is how we
show support for their action.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 She went on. “We
have no say in how we are ruled. Still we must pay taxes on
everything we buy. We boycott British goods. That shows we will not
stand for unfair rules. I will not put money in the king's pocket! I
would sooner do without something I love.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Soon the neighbors
began to arrive. Many of them carried small spinning wheels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 Mrs. Roberts said,
“Good day, Mrs. Addams. You are kind to have us. My mother thinks I
buy thread and cloth at the market. She still supports the British.
She buys goods from England. She would not understand why I spin my
own thread and weave my own cloth.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Another neighbor
said, &quot;I enjoy your spinning bees. It is good to work together.
Sarah, I look forward to a cup of your Liberty Tea.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 Mrs. Addams
nodded. &quot;It helps to be together when we must make hard
choices.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 The women chatted
and began to spin wool. Sarah thought, It is good to fight for our
rights. But I still would enjoy a nice cup of English tea.</p>
