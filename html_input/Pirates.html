<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Pirates are thieves
on the high seas. Real pirates are very different from the likable
pirates in popular films. Pirates use weapons and force to take over
ships. The ships have crews and may have valuable goods onboard.
Pirates capture people and products and demand a ransom for their
safe return.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In 2009, a band of
pirates was working along the coast of Somalia. Somalia is in Africa.
The Somali pirates took over a U.S. cargo ship and held the captain
hostage. The U.S. Navy freed him by killing three pirates. The ship’s
crew began carrying weapons. When the same ship was attacked again,
they were able to fight off the pirates. That failed attempt did not
stop the pirates. Somali pirates continued to board ships of all
nations and sometimes killed their hostages.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Pirates have a long
history of violence. In the early 1700s, Blackbeard was the most
violent. He worked off the coasts of the West Indies and the American
colonies. He wore two swords at his waist. If he needed to use them,
he did not waste any time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some historians say
Blackbeard never killed anyone who did not try to kill him first. But
in two years of pirating, Blackbeard was so bloodthirsty that today
he is still considered the world’s most notorious pirate.</p>
