<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Anton
van Leeuwenhoek, Not the Father of the Microscope</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 A whole world of
tiny creatures is all around us, but we can’t see them with only
our eyes. Anton van Leeuwenhoek was one of the first people to learn
about this world. His inventions and discoveries about this world
also changed the future of medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Anton was born in
Delft, Netherlands, in 1632. His father was a basket maker who died
when Anton was only five. Anton worked from an early age but got
little schooling. He went to work for a cloth dealer when he was
sixteen. Later, he became a cloth merchant. He also took part in
local government. Unlike most scientists today, Anton did not go to
college.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Although Anton was
not trained, he loved to study science. Many people call van
Leeuwenhoek the father of the microscope, but this is not really
correct. He did not invent it. Van Leeuwenhoek probably saw plans for
a simple microscope in a book. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 In about 1660, van
Leeuwenhoek began to make a new kind of lens. He used the new lens to
build his own microscopes. These lenses magnified tiny things 200
times their real size. His microscopes were more powerful than
earlier models. His inventions led to many important discoveries.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 Van Leeuwenhoek
could see tiny creatures through his lens. He claimed he could see
one-celled animals. At first, many important scientists did not
believe van Leeuwenhoek. They said these tiny animals were not real.
Even so, Anton didn’t give up. He said, “I’ve taken no notice
of those who have said, ‘Why take so much trouble and what good is
it?’”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Later, other
scientists realized that van Leeuwenhoek was right. He had discovered
living things that no one knew about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 Van Leeuwenhoek
made an even more important discovery with his microscope. He found
bacteria. These germs can make people sick. They can cause many
diseases. Knowing about these germs helped doctors learn to treat
sick people. Anton’s discovery of bacteria improved the lives of
countless people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 Van Leeuwenhoek
died in 1723. But the discoveries he made with his microscope live on
long after his death.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 Van Leeuwenhoek
once said, “A man has always to be busy with his thoughts if
anything is to be accomplished.” We are lucky he stayed busy
thinking about the hidden world just under his nose.
