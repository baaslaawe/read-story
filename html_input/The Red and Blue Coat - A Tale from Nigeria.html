Red and Blue Coat - A Tale from Nigeria</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 There once lived
two field mice who were the closest of friends. They stayed best
friends over the years. When they were all grown up, they chose
neighboring fields to live on. The only thing dividing their land was
a narrow path.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 As the two friends
worked in their fields collecting food, Mr. Jackal watched. He was
jealous that the two mice got along so well. He spent many hours
thinking about them. Hmmm, maybe they never fight because they are
both tiny and look at the world through the same beady eyes, thought
Mr. Jackal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Mr. Jackal loved
mischief, and he liked to play tricks on the animals in the village.
One day, he decided to play a trick on the two mice. Mr. Jackal made
himself a coat that was two colors, the right half blue and the left
half red.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 As the two mice
gathered food in their own fields, Mr. Jackal sang loudly as he
walked down the path between them. The two friends took a break from
their work to listen to the trickster’s beautiful singing. They
watched him stroll along.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 At the end of the
day, the two friends met on the path to say good night to each other.
Then one friend said to the other, “Wasn’t that a beautiful red
coat that Mr. Jackal was wearing today?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 “Yes, it was a
beautiful coat, but it was blue,” said the other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 “You are wrong,
my friend! It was red.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 “You need
glasses,” said the other. “It was blue!”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 “I can see fine,
but you don’t remember well,” the friend replied.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 The friends
continued to argue and insult each other. Just as they were saying,
“Our friendship is over,” Mr. Jackal came walking up the path
wearing the coat. The friends could see that the coat was half red
and half blue. Mr. Jackal laughed at the look on the friends’
faces.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 “We have lived
like brothers our whole lives,” said one mouse. “It is your fault
that we began fighting.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">12 “Don’t blame
me,” replied Mr. Jackal with a grin. “Both of you were right, and
both of you were wrong. You were fighting because neither of you
looked at my coat from the other’s point of view.”</p>
