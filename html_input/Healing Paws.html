<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Cree Hayuga is at an
age when most kids like to play video games or hang out with their
friends. Instead, this fifth grader from Santa Fe, N.M., spends three
hours each Wednesday afternoon training dogs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">She volunteers at
Assistance Dogs of the West. It is one of several programs around the
country that train dogs to be the eyes, ears, and hands for people
with disabilities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Cree joined the
program when she was in fourth grade because she loves animals. Dogs
in the program learn how to open and shut doors, turn lights on and
off, throw away trash, and pick up items for people in wheelchairs.
&quot;The hardest command to teach [a dog] is the stand-stay
position,&quot; Cree told Senior Edition. She is referring to the
position in which the dog stands at its owner's side when it is not
doing anything else.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Cree says that
training dogs has taught her patience and responsibility. &quot;It's
really fun,&quot; she said. &quot;The animals get really attached to
you, and it's hard to say good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Although saying
good-bye isn't easy, Cree knows that she has helped both the dog and
its grateful owner. Cree wants to be a veterinarian when she grows
up.
