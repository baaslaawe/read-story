<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Stage
Fright!</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I stood
behind the closed curtains before the show started and peeked into
the auditorium. The whole school was there! My parents sat in the
front row! My legs shook with fright. My throat was dry. I could not
remember my lines. How was I going to act my part in the play? A hand
grabbed my shoulder and I jumped. Maria laughed when she saw my
surprise. “You sure are jumpy, Bob,” she said.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“I’m
afraid to go onstage, Maria. What if I trip and fall? I can’t
remember my lines!”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Calm
down,” Maria said. “You have stage fright. I know a trick that
will help you calm down. Just pretend that everyone in the audience
is wearing a funny hat.”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">She
hugged me. Her kindness made me feel better.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When
the curtain opened, I walked onto the stage. I looked out at the
crowd and remembered Maria’s words. I pretended my parents wore
clown hats. I pretended my teacher wore a feather hat. The crowd
looked silly in hats. It was funny. I lost my stage fright.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Friends,
Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears,” I said boldly to the
audience.
