<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">John
Lewis</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1   John Lewis has
been fighting for equal rights for more than  fifty years. Time and
again, he has put his life on the line for  his beliefs. He has been
called “a genuine American hero.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 John Robert Lewis
was born in Troy, Alabama, in 1940. His parents were sharecroppers.
They farmed land owned by other people and paid a share of their
crops as rent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Education was
important to Lewis from a young age. He could not go to most of the
schools in his hometown because he was black. So he went to
segregated schools for black children only. Later, he went to
college.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 In the early
1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. inspired Lewis to join the struggle for
civil rights. Like King, Lewis believed in the idea of nonviolence.
He became a leader for peaceful change. He took part in sit-ins,
marches, and other nonviolent protests. Lewis sat in with other
students at lunch counters for white people only. He wanted these
restaurants to accommodate people of all races. He rode on segregated
buses with other students. These Freedom Riders believed that
everyone should be able to choose any available seat on buses. He
walked in peaceful marches for voting rights. Many people joined in
these protests.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 Sometimes mobs of
angry people attacked and beat civil rights protesters. Lewis was
arrested more than forty times. He spent time in jail for his
protests.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Finally, laws
began to change the country. Public schools and libraries had to be
opened to all people. Segregation ended in public restaurants, on
buses, and in many other places. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped
to make sure all adults could vote.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 Lewis ran voter
registration drives in the South. He helped add millions of new
voters. In 1986, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives—and
won. Since then, Lewis has won many times.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8   As a
congressman, John Lewis continues his fight for equal  rights today.
He dreams of a better world. “Don’t measure America by its
achievement but by its potential,” he once said.</p>
