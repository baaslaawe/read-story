a Budget</p>

for getting, spending, and saving money. Follow these steps to make a
budget. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">First, get a
notebook. Each page will be for a different week. Write the date at
the top of the page. Then draw and label a chart as shown below. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In the first box,
write down all the money you expect to get: exactly how much it will
be and where it will come from. In the second box, write down where
this money will go. Start with all necessary expenses. Then write
down things you would like to spend money on. Last, write down how
much money you plan to save, if any. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This is your plan,
which may or may not work out. Keep track of what really happens in
the boxes on the right. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Budgets are a great
way to track your money. If you get into the habit of keeping a
budget now, you will learn to manage your money for the future.</p>
