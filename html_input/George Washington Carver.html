Washington Carver</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">George Washington
Carver lived from 1864 to 1943. When he was young, Carver enjoyed
art, but he couldn't afford paint. Instead, he used blackberry juice.
He used the hair from a horse's tail as his paintbrush. He even
studied art when he was in college, but he also studied plant life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It's a good thing
that he did. He spent much of his life helping people by showing them
better ways to farm. His ideas have improved the lives of farmers in
many countries around the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Booker T. Washington
was a very important and famous African-American educator. He invited
Carver to teach at Tuskegee Institute, a college in Alabama. Carver
was in charge of farm research. He taught students how to farm. He
also worked with southern farmers on their land. In the southern part
of the United States, most farmers had grown cotton for so many years
that the soil had worn out. Carver showed them how to improve the
land.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Carver said the
farmers should plant peanuts. Peanuts would enrich the soil. Farmers
asked who would buy so many peanuts if they planted them. Carver
answered by finding more than 300 new ways to use peanuts. Farmers
could feed the vines to farm animals. They could use the hulls for
fertilizer. Carver even found a way to make paper from the peanut
shells. He also found new ways to use soybeans and sweet potatoes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When Carver died, he
left his money to help people to keep working on farm research.
Today, people from many countries come to the George Washington
Carver Foundation at the Tuskegee Institute. There they learn better
ways of farming. The ideas he taught are still important.
