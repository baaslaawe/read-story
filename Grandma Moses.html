Moses was born on September 7, 1860. She grew up on a farm in New
York. As a child, Anna Mary did many chores. She helped with the
smaller children. Anna Mary took care of the animals, made candles
and soap, and hung clothes out to dry. Life on the farm was fun, too!
Friends and family had picnics together, rode on big sleds, and
played in the snow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As an adult, Anna
Mary painted things she remembered about life on the farm. She became
famous for her paintings. By using paint and color, Grandma Moses
shows us how much fun it can be when families and friends live and
work together. Grandma Moses lived to be 101 years old!</p>
