Paulsen writes stories that young people love to read. You might know
some of his most popular books: Dogsong, Hatchet, and The Winter
Room. All of them were named Newbery Honor Books.</span></font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="background: transparent">Gary’s
love of books began early in his life. He was born in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, in 1939. Winters there can be very bitter, and one day
Gary walked into a library to escape the cold. That’s when he
discovered books. Not only was he warm, but he also had fun reading.</span></font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="background: transparent">When
Gary was 15, he got his first job—as a construction worker. Over
the years he worked as a farmhand, a truck driver, and a sailor. Then
he got a job as a magazine editor. That’s when he really learned
the craft of writing. He published his first book in 1966.</span></font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="background: transparent">In
1983, Gary’s life changed when he started racing with a dogsled
team. Training the dogs and racing was hard work. Often he worked 18
to 20 hours a day. Then he entered the Iditarod, a famous dogsled
race in Alaska. The 1,200-mile race was the most challenging
experience of his life, and he loved it. However, after the second
race, he had to stop racing due to poor health. That’s when he
turned to full-time writing.</span></font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="background: transparent">Many
of Paulsen’s books tell of young people overcoming great odds to
survive. The main character in Hatchet, for example, survives a plane
crash. He lives alone in the Canadian wilderness until he is rescued.
Paulsen fills his book with details that make the story come alive.
He uses his knowledge of the outdoors to create his settings. He uses
what he knows about people to create real-life characters.</span></font></font></font></p>
