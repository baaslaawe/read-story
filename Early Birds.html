<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Early
Birds</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1. “Dad, we go to
fairs all the time, but I never get to go on the rides. Can’t I
ride the Ferris wheel, just this once?” Kayla asked wistfully. My
sister’s rich soprano voice was full of pleading.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2. Dad checked his
watch and said, “Well, we don’t go on stage for an hour, so why
not? But be back here by 12:45 sharp, both you and Emilou: the Early
Birds have to be on time!”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3. The Early Birds
is our family band. The real star of it is my father, the finest
pedal steel player in the Colorado River Basin, according to one
newspaper. Mom plays accordion, my older brothers play drums and
guitar, and Kayla and I sing. Our voices blend well because we’re
sisters and because we sing together constantly. It’s mostly
old-timey music, like “Oh, Susanna” and other songs you can tap
your foot to while you’re eating a corn dog. In the summer we play
county fairs within a few hundred miles of home.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4. This fair in Utah
boasted a truly gigantic Ferris wheel. While Kayla was on her ride, I
went to the animal tent. I was leaning on a fence trying to decide
which piglet was cutest when I heard someone say the Ferris wheel was
stuck. I made a beeline for the ride and found Mom and Dad there
already. The mechanic had the big wheel’s machinery spread out in
pieces all around him.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5. The announcer
boomed out, “Nothing to worry about, folks. Everyone’s perfectly
safe, but this repair could take up to an hour.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6. My eyes scanned
the big wheel as I thought of Kayla trapped several hundred feet up.
I knew she was calm because Kayla is braver than I am about many
things, including singing. Kayla always sings the lead part, and she
takes all the solos because her voice is so beautiful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7. “There’s no
way she’ll be down here in time to sing with us. If we miss our
turn onstage, we lose our $500 payment,” said Mom. They looked at
me. Dad asked, “Emilou, do you think you can sing Kayla’s part?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8. As the backup
singer, I harmonize with the lead singer, which is often harder than
singing the melody. But sometimes I practice the melodies when I’m
alone. I certainly know Kayla’s parts, but I feel shy about being
the center of attention.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9. When I said I
could do it, Mom beamed at me and promised to sing harmony as well as
she could.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10. As we joined my
brothers onstage, I heard “This Land Is Your Land” coming from
the topmost cars on the wheel. Kayla was leading her fellow
passengers in one of our most popular songs! We all looked at each
other and chuckled. Kayla was doing just fine— and I’d get my
first chance to sing the lead.
