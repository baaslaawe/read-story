<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Watch
Out for That Iceberg!</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 One
calm, clear night in 1912, the dangers of icebergs drifting into
ship-traveled waters became shockingly clear. That was the night the
Titanic sank. In response to the tragedy, several countries jointly
created the International Ice Patrol. Since 1914, the IIP has
gathered data about icebergs, tracked their movements, and issued
warnings about them. It has even tried destroying them! The IIP (part
of the U.S. Coast Guard) coordinates its critical work with several
other agencies and a number of foreign governments.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Where
Does Iceberg Danger Occur?</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2
Icebergs are found in several regions, carried there by currents
after breaking off from glaciers. However, the North Atlantic is the
only ocean where large numbers of icebergs routinely enter major
shipping lanes. The risk of collision is especially high near the
Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The IIP concentrates its efforts in that
area.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Why
Can’t Ships Just Sail Someplace Else?</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 They
do. During the “ice season” (mid-February through July), the IIP
issues regular reports outlining areas for ships to avoid. However,
shipping is a business. Whatever the cargo, the goal is to get from
Point A to Point B as quickly and cheaply as possible. Sailing
hundreds of extra miles increases the ship’s operating costs. It
can also put the cargo at risk (if it is food that might rot, for
example). The IIP reports allow ships to plan routes that are both
safe and as efficient as possible.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">What
Makes Icebergs So Dangerous?</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4
“Official” icebergs rise at least 16 feet (5 meters) above sea
level. (Most of the ice hides below the surface.) Each also covers an
area of at least 5,382 square feet (500 square meters). In any
run-in, such a huge piece of ice will definitely be the winner. In
addition, icebergs can be very hard to see. Weather, light
conditions, the color of the water, and other factors all make it
hard to identify icebergs while they are still a safe distance away.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">How
Does the IIP Locate Icebergs?</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 Over
the years, the IIP has tried numerous detection methods. For a long
time, shipboard lookouts with binoculars were the best alternative.
After World War II, aircraft largely took over. Planes could move
around faster, and both binoculars and radar worked better from the
air. Radar itself has kept improving. For example, it has gotten much
better at telling icebergs from ships. Satellites offer promise but
so far cannot replace Earth-based systems. Finally, reports to the
IIP from ships traveling through danger zones are extremely
important. The IIP relies on all of these methods in its efforts to
keep ships safe.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">So Far,
So Good</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 As of
the 100-year anniversary of the Titanic disaster, no ship that heeded
the warnings of the International Ice Patrol had ever struck an
iceberg. Good job, IIP!</p>
