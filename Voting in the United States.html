<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Voting
in the United States</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Can
you vote? If you are 18 years or older and a United States citizen,
then you can.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Americans
could not always vote. Until 1776, Great Britain made all decisions
concerning the American colonies. The British set the taxes and made
the laws. Then Americans decided to fight for freedom. In 1776, they
declared their independence. After the Revolutionary War, voting
became possible—at least, for some.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	The
first people allowed to vote were wealthy men who were at least 21
years old and owned property. Then in 1820, the law was changed to
give white males 21 years and older the right to vote. In 1872, the
law was changed again. Black American males were given the right to
vote.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Women
wanted the right to vote, too. They marched in the streets and
struggled for many years to gain equal rights. Finally, in 1920,
women got the right to vote. Of course, they had to be over 21 years
old.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	In
1924, Native Americans gained citizenship. It was not until the
1960s, however, that Native Americans could vote in every state. In
1971, the law was amended to lower the voting age to 18. Now male and
female teenagers could vote!</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Over
the years, more people acquired the right to vote. Does that mean
that we have more and more voters? Not really. Many people don’t
bother to vote. In the 2012 presidential election, only 62% of
eligible citizens voted. More than one-third of possible voters did
not vote!</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Why
don’t people vote? Some people say that they don’t think their
vote counts for much. Other people forget or don’t think that
voting is important.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Actually,
voting is very important because it is how we choose our leaders. We
also vote to make new laws. When we vote, we decide how to govern our
town, our state, and our country.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="URW Gothic L, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">	Voting
is not only a right. It is a privilege. Many people fought long and
hard so that Americans could vote. It’s our responsibility to honor
that fight. What will you do when you’re old enough to vote?</font></font></p>
