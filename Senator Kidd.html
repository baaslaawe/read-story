Kidd</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The TV reporter
smiled into the camera. “I’m standing on the steps of the Capitol
Building with Senator B.A. Kidd. Senator Kidd is the first
ten-year-old ever elected to Congress. What new bills do you hope to
introduce, Senator Kidd?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Senator Kidd
adjusted his tie. “I want to make sure we still have a country when
I grow up,” he said. “I want to make laws that are tough on
polluters. I want to make laws that encourage world peace.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Admirable!”
said the reporter. “What else do you hope to accomplish?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“I plan to form a
committee to investigate a big injustice in our country,” replied
Senator Kidd. “The amount of homework some teachers give is a
crime! Teachers used to be kids. They should know we need more time
for fun!”</p>
