Circle</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Grandma
opened her door to let me in. Her house was full of knitted
knickknacks. The dining room table wore a knitted tablecloth. The
couch and chairs wore knitted sweaters. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I was
bummed. I would rather play video games than join Grandma’s
knitting circle, but Mom made me give it a try. Grandma’s friends
looked up from their knitting when I walked into the living room. A
teapot wore a knitted cozy on the coffee table in the middle of the
room.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“We’re
excited about you joining our knitting circle, Marcos,” Grandma
said. All the women agreed. “We’ll teach you all the stitches you
need to know. What do you want to make, dear?”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“I’m
not sure, Grandma,” I said. “Isn’t knitting for girls?”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“I’ve
been part of Grandma’s knitting circle for years,” said Grandpa,
entering the room from the backyard. He wore a beautiful knitted
sweater with a flying eagle on the back. “I’m proud to say I made
this sweater.”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Wow!”
I exclaimed. “Maybe I could make a sweater with a football on the
back!”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Have
a seat,” Grandma said as she poured me a cup of tea. “Welcome to
the knitting circle!”</p>
