<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
One That Got Away</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 One rainy day
after school, Colin ran up the steps to his front porch. He had just
unlocked the door when he heard a clucking noise coming from the bush
by the porch. Colin bent down to peek underneath and came face to
face with a brightly colored chicken.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 “Hey, where did
you come from?” he asked, as the bird circled him, shaking its
soaked feathers. Before he could stop it, the chicken pressed its
beak against the half-open door and zoomed inside.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 Laughing, Colin
chased the excited bird around the sofa, under the dining room table,
and into the kitchen, where it started pecking the floor and clucking
noisily.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 Colin said, “I
wonder if we have anything a chicken could eat.” He put some
crackers on the floor and soon every crumb was gone. The boy found a
carrier and some litter left from their old cat and put the bird in
the carrier. It flung the litter around for a while and then settled
down.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 When Colin’s
mother got home, she was not happy about the new guest. She spent the
next hour calling neighbors who kept backyard flocks, and then
everyone those people could think of, but nobody was missing a
chicken.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 Dad just smiled
and said, “It isn’t often that a meal just walks in the front
door in this city. Maybe we could keep it for a while and fatten it
up.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 “We can’t eat
Gracie! I’ve already taught her to do a trick,” Colin cried out,
but he could see Dad didn’t really mean it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 “I wouldn’t
mind having fresh eggs, but where on earth would we keep a chicken?”
his mother wondered. “The backyard is too small, and it can’t
live in that carrier forever. Let’s sleep on it.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 The next morning,
Gracie started crowing—loudly—before dawn. Colin found his father
sitting in his bathrobe reading an encyclopedia article about
chickens. He turned to Colin and said, “A better name for this bird
might be Gary—I think we’ve got a rooster here.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 His mother came
out of the bedroom yawning. “That means it’s never going to lay
eggs,” she said. “I just can’t have it waking us up so early.
We all need our sleep.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 Colin peered at
the bird through the bars of the carrier. “Gracie—I mean
Gary—we’ll have to find a new home for you,” he said
dejectedly. The bird clucked softly, as though it too was sad.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">12 That afternoon,
Colin’s mother came home from work looking pleased. She said, “I
called a few farmers and found one that would be happy to take the
rooster. Are you ready for a ride to the country?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">13 Colin nodded and
picked up the carrier. “You’ll be happier living with other
chickens, Gary, but I’m going to miss you.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
