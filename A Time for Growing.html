<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
Time for Growing</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1 Grandpa came to
stay with us for the summer. He was pretty quiet at first, but one
day he said, “Everybody should know how to grow their own food.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 Boring, I thought.
Then he described things he grew when he was a boy. I could taste the
butter on the corn on the cob. I could hear the snap of fresh green
beans. I could even smell the pumpkin pie fresh from the oven.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3 That night Mama
said, “Grandpa hasn’t been excited about anything since Grandma
died. It would be great if you would help him in the garden.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4 The next day I saw
Tony and Alvin. “Hey, Chris, practice starts next week,” said
Alvin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5 I didn’t answer
right away. Then I said, “I can’t play this summer.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6 After I told the
guys what my plans were, Tony said, “Instead of baseball? Are you
kidding?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7 My cheeks felt
hot. I just shrugged and said I’d see them around.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8 Alvin hooted, “Eat
your vegetables!” as they rode off on their bikes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9 Grandpa and I got
busy. We hauled dirt, made rows, and dug holes. I helped pick out
seeds at the store. We planted some blueberry bushes, too. We made a
scarecrow to keep birds from filching the corn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10 The days flew by.
We weeded and watered. Grandpa showed me how to tell a ladybug from a
Japanese beetle. He taught me to water plants at the bottom so the
leaves don’t get wet. We ate fresh food from the garden every
night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">11 We went to see
the guys play ball a few times. I had been so busy, I hadn’t even
missed playing on the team.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">12 One day Grandpa
said, “It’s time for me to go home, Chris. I’m leaving next
Thursday.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">13 I asked, “What
about all the stuff in the garden?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">14 He suggested that
we have a feast to celebrate our success.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">15 The next night
Alvin and Tony came over for dinner. “Don’t make me eat
vegetables,” Tony whispered when he arrived. But their eyes bulged
when they saw all the food on the table. They tasted everything and
even asked for seconds on beans and squash.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">16 For dessert, we
served two kinds of pie. Tony and Alvin looked at the pie, then at
Grandpa and me. They both talked at once. “Do you think we could
help in the garden next year?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">17 Grandpa and I
just smiled and nodded as we had some more pie.</p>
