<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
Trip to Remember: Climbing the Snow King</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Slap! I
shut my book as Mom called to me. “Ready to hike?” she asked as I
neared her. I nodded and replied, “Absolutely!”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It was
a sunny August morning in Jackson, Wyoming. We were on a family
vacation. Even though I had been there three times, I had been eager
to return. Last summer, Mom, Dad, and I had hiked up a mountain named
Snow King. It is used for skiing in the winter. I loved the hike so
much that we decided to do it again. I wanted today’s hike to be as
much fun as last year’s. I hoped it would be even more fun because
my grandparents were hiking with us this time.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
walked out of our hotel and onto a street. It was a fairly long walk,
but soon enough we were at the base of the towering mountain. Horses
trekked up a winding, steep path. Their riders bounced around as the
horses jogged.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
walking trail was beside the horse trail. I pointed to a steep
shortcut on the trail while I raced toward it yelling, “Let’s
go!”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I had
to take big, running strides to climb the trail. After a while I was
breathing quickly and needed to stop. The sun was intense. I was
afraid that if climbing this part of the trail was so difficult, we
wouldn’t be able to make it to the top.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When my
grandmother reached the shortcut, she told us that going onward would
be too hard for her. She said she’d meet us at the top by riding
the ski lift instead. My grandfather said he’d tough it out with
us. We moved up the steep trail.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It was
so hot out that we had to rest frequently in the shade. People would
jog by us and we marveled at their energy. We often had to grab rocks
on the steepest inclines just to keep from slipping back.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
sights along the way made it totally worthwhile. We passed a
graveyard in a steep decline right next to the trail and joked,
“That’s where people who die hiking the trail are buried.” I
noticed workers on the mountainside putting their supplies in a shed
bearing a warning sign:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Explosives!
Stay out!”</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
favorite sight was the wildflowers. They bloomed abundantly all over
the mountain in vivid patches of orange and blue. They brought an
oasis of color to the drab mountainside.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Suddenly,
we came to a fork in the road. “Which way should we go now?” we
wondered.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Two
ladies who lived in Jackson told us that a shortcut was to the right.
Tired and hot, we took their advice.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
shortcut trail seemed more like a “longcut.” We zigzagged up the
mountain. There were so many switchbacks that it was almost dizzying.
Plus, the trail was very narrow. We could walk only single file, in a
line, not side by side. The sun continued to beat down on us without
mercy. Still, we continued on. Soon we were rewarded with a stretch
of trail where we were surrounded by different grasses and
wildflowers. Then we came to a place under the ski lift where the
ground slanted sharply. “Stay on the trail!” a sign commanded. We
didn’t need to be warned. One misstep and you could go rolling a
long way down.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Finally,
we could see the top of the mountain. We ran up a steep trail. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">An hour
and half after we had started, we crossed a finish line of flowers
and bugs. We were so happy! We are from flatland Kansas. We had just
climbed a steep rise to a peak 7,808 feet high.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
grandmother rode up the ski lift as she had planned. We took pictures
and stared at the beautiful view below. After that, we rode down the
ski lift together.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
would have been quicker and easier to simply ride up the ski lift.
But I have longlasting memories because my family and I hiked up Snow
King together. We would have missed out on so much if we rode up the
mountain: the flowers we smelled, the pictures we took, and the
laughs we shared.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">So get
out in nature and see what special place you can find—and what
memories you will make on the way.
