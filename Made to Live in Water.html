breathe air and so do dolphins. They breathe through an opening in
the top of their head. The opening is called a blowhole. The blowhole
is a flap of skin that can open and close. When a dolphin swims to
the water’s surface, it uses strong muscles to open its blowhole.
The blowhole closes as a dolphin dives back underwater.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">People
do not have to think about breathing while they sleep. Breathing
happens automatically. A dolphin must be awake to control its
blowhole. And it needs to rest. How can it breathe and rest? When a
dolphin rests, it swims slowly. Half of its brain shuts down. The
other half stays alert for danger. It also signals the dolphin when
to rise out of the water for a breath of air. After a couple of
hours, the halves of the dolphin’s brain trade jobs.</p>
